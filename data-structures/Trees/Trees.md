### A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner.

- Root: top node of the tree
- Child: node directly connected to another node when moving away from root node.
- parent: opposite of child node
- siblings- a group of node with same parent
- leaf- a node with no child node
- edge- connection between two nodes.

### NOTE: In a tree, there is no connection between siblings, there is only parent child relationship otherwise, it will be a graph data structure.

### Uses of trees:

1. HTML DOM
2. Network Routing
3. Abstract syntax tree
4. Artificial intelligence eg. decision tree
5. folders in operating system

### Binary Tree: Each node at most can have two children.

### Binary Search Tree:

- It is type of binary tree, ordered or sorted binary tree in which nodes are arragned in certain order.
- each node can have max of two children
- Every node to the left of the parent node is less than parent node
- Every node to the right of the parent node is greater than the parent node.

### Big O of binary search trees

- Insertion - O(log n)
- Searching - O(log n)
- NOTE: not guranteed of time complexity
